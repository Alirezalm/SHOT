# The Supporting Hyperplane Optimization Toolkit (SHOT)

SHOT is a solver for mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. It is a global solver, i.e., guarantees to find the optimal solution (if one exists) to convex problems. 

SHOT may be able to solve certain types of nonconvex problems to global optimality as well, but should mostly be considered an heuristic method for problems containing nonconvexities. 

SHOT is described in the paper:
