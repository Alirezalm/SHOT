# The Supporting Hyperplane Optimization Toolkit (SHOT)

SHOT is a solver for convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. It is
described in the forthcoming paper:

Lundell, A. Kronqvist, J. and Westerlund, T. The Supporting Hyperplane Optimization Toolkit: A Polyhedral Outer Approximation Based 
Convex MINLP Solver Utilizing a Single Branching Tree Approach (2018)
