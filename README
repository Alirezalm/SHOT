Supporting Hyperplane Optimization Toolkit (SHOT):

SHOT is a solver for convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. It is
described in the paper:

The Supporting Hyperplane Optimization Toolkit: A Polyhedral Outer Approximation Based 
Convex MINLP Solver Utilizing a Single Branching Tree Approach

by Andreas Lundell, Jan Kronqvist and Tapio Westerlund

SHOT utilizes the following COIN-OR subprojects
- Optimization Services (OS)
- Ipopt
- GAMSlinks
- Cbc

It also utilizes functionality from the Boost libraries.

SHOT can also utilize functionality from the following commercial software

- IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio
- Gurobi 
- GAMS

In addition Ipopt may also utilize:
- HSL. A collection of Fortran codes for large scale scientific computation. http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/
